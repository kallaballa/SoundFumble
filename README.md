SoundFumble
===========

SoundFumble is a gimp plugin that renders images to sound.
It does it by writing the image samples directly to an alsa device. You can live edit the images while they are played.
Note: With Gimp 2.8 you can make full use of alpha blending and layers during playback.
PCM playback settings are configurable.
